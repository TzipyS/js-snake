# Snake Game (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

A browser-based **Snake** game built as a high-school web programming project. Play in the browser, pick a difficulty level, save personal high scores, and compete on a local leaderboard.

## Features

- **Canvas gameplay** - snake movement with arrow keys; hold a key to move faster
- **Custom graphics** - snake head, apples, and wall tiles

- **High score table** - sorted leaderboard, delete players, play again or switch user
- **Responsive layout** - adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes
